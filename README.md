# LittleHorse Examples

Our quickstarts (for example, [Java](https://github.com/littlehorse-enterprises/lh-quickstart-java) and [Go](https://github.com/littlehorse-enterprises/lh-quickstart-go)) are great for getting a LittleHorse Workflow running quickly. However, due to their brevity they do not show everything you need to build a useful application on top of LittleHorse.

This repository will grow into a collection of reference applications that show you how to use LittleHorse in various different situations.
