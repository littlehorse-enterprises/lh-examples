Some helpful suggestions along the way:

1. You must explicitly state parameter types AND return type in the function definition.
    This is because LittleHorse does a lot of type checking when a Task is registered to the LittleHorse Server.
    Otherwise, LittleHorse will raise errors when trying to run create_task_def()

    1a. Also, all LH Task Definitions must have the 'async' keyword

    For example, this IS a VALID LH Task Definition: 

        async def function(a: int, b: int) -> int:   
    
    However, these are NOT:

        def function(a, b):
        def function(a: int, b: int):
        def function(a, b) -> int:

2. When registering a TaskDef with the LittleHorse Server, the task name must be lowercase and not contain spaces

    Allowed: 
        "this-is-a-valid-task-name"
        "validtaskname"
        
    Not Allowed:
        "This is Not Valid"
        "NotValid"
