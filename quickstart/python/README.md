**Get started in under 5 minutes, or your money back!** 😉

This repo contains a minimal example to get you started using LittleHorse in Python. [LittleHorse](https://littlehorse.io) is a high-performance orchestration engine which lets you build workflow-driven microservice applications with ease.

You can run this example in two ways:

1. Using a local deployment of a LittleHorse Server (instructions below, requires one `docker` command).
2. Using a LittleHorse Cloud Sandbox (to get one, contact `info@littlehorse.io`).

This quickstart demonstrates a Know Your Customer (KYC) workflow. The `WfSpec` takes in three input variables (`firstName`, `lastName`, and `ssn`) which represent a customer who is attempting to sign up for some service. Before the vendor can accept the customer, they must verify the customer prospect's identity using a third-party identity verification service—for example, due to compliance reasons.

Our workflow will:

1. Execute a `TaskRun` that requests a fictitious third-party identity verification service to verify the specified customer's identity.
2. Wait for the verification process to complete (using a [LittleHorse `ExternalEvent`](https://littlehorse.io/docs/server/concepts/external-events) )
3. Either accept the customer into the system or reject them; both of which are also [LittleHorse `TaskRun`s](https://littlehorse.io/docs/server/concepts/tasks).

# Prerequisites

Your system needs:

- `python` 3.9 or later
- `docker` to run the LittleHorse Server, OR access to a LittleHorse Cloud Sandbox
- Homebrew (tested on Mac or Linux) to install `lhctl`

## Python Setup

We need a python environment that has the `littlehorse-client` pip package. We recommend making a python virtual environment. To install the required packages:

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## LittleHorse CLI

Install the LittleHorse CLI:

```bash
brew install littlehorse-enterprises/lh/lhctl
```

## Local LittleHorse Server Setup

If you have obtained a LittleHorse Cloud Sandbox, you can skip this step and just follow the configuration instructions you received from the LittleHorse Team (remember to set your environment variables!).

To run a LittleHorse Server locally in one command, you can run:

```sh
docker run --pull always --name lh-standalone --rm -d -p 2023:2023 -p 8080:8080 \
  ghcr.io/littlehorse-enterprises/littlehorse/lh-standalone:latest
```

Using the local LittleHorse Server takes about 15-25 seconds to start up, but it does not require any further configuration. Please note that the `lh-standalone` docker image requires at least 1.5GB of memory to function properly. This is because it runs Apache Kafka, the LittleHorse Server, and the LittleHorse Dashboard all in one container.

## Verifying Setup

At this point, whether you are using a local Docker deployment or a LittleHorse Cloud Sandbox, you should be able to contact the LittleHorse Server:

```sh
>lhctl whoami
{
  "id":  {
    "id":  "anonymous"
  },
  "createdAt":  "2025-03-12T21:24:47.593Z",
  "perTenantAcls":  {},
  "globalAcls":  {
    "acls":  [
      {
        "resources":  [
          "ACL_ALL_RESOURCES"
        ],
        "allowedActions":  [
          "ALL_ACTIONS"
        ],
        "name":  ""
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**You should also be able to see the dashboard** at `http://localhost:8080`. It should be empty, but we will put some data in there soon when we run the workflow!

If you _can't_ get the above to work, please let us know on our [Community Slack Workspace](https://launchpass.com/littlehorsecommunity/free). We'll be happy to help.

# Running the Example

Without further ado, let's run the example start-to-finish.

If you haven't done so already, at this point go ahead and clone this repository to your local machine.

## Register Metadata

Let's run the `register.py` app, which does 3 things:

1. Registers the `verify-identity`, `notify-customer-verified`, and `notify-customer-not-verified` task definitions (`TaskDef`s) with the LittleHorse Server.
2. Registers an `ExternalEventDef` named `identity-verified` with the LittleHorse Server.
3. Registers a `WfSpec` named `quickstart` with the LittleHorse Server.

A [`WfSpec`](https://littlehorse.io/docs/server/concepts/workflows) specifies a process which can be orchestrated by LittleHorse. A [`TaskDef`](https://littlehorse.io/docs/server/concepts/tasks) tells LittleHorse about a specification of a task that can be executed as a step in a `WfSpec`.

```sh
python -m quickstart.register
```

You can inspect your `WfSpec` with `lhctl` as follows. It's ok if the response doesn't make sense, we will see it soon!

```sh
lhctl get wfSpec quickstart
```

Now, go to your dashboard in your browser (`http://localhost:8080`). Click on the `quickstart` WfSpec. You should see something that looks like a flow-chart. That is your Workflow Specification!

## Run Workflow

Now, let's run our first `WfRun`! Use `lhctl` to run an instance of our `WfSpec`.

```sh
# Run the 'quickstart' WfSpec, and set 'first-name' = "John", 'last-name' = "Doe", 'ssn' = 123456789
lhctl run quickstart first-name Obi-Wan last-name Kenobi ssn 123456789
```

The response prints the initial status of the `WfRun`. Pull out the `id` and copy it!

Let's look at our `WfRun` once again. To do it with the CLI, please run:

```sh
lhctl get wfRun <wf_run_id>
```

If you would like to see it on the dashboard, go to the `WfSpec` page and scroll down. You should see your ID under the `RUNNING` column. Please double click on your `WfRun` id, and it will take you to the `WfRun` page.

Note that the status is `RUNNING`! Why hasn't it completed? That's because we haven't yet started the workers which executes the `verify-identity` and `notify-customer-verified` or `notify-customer-not-verified` tasks. Want to verify that? Let's search for all tasks in the queue which haven't been executed yet. You should see an entry whose `wfRunId` matches the Id from above:

```sh
lhctl search taskRun verify-identity --taskDefName verify-identity --status TASK_SCHEDULED
```

You can also see the `TaskRun` node on the workflow. It's highlighted, meaning that it's already running! If you click on it, you'll see that it's in the `TASK_SCHEDULED` status.

## Run Task Workers

Now let's start our workers, so that our blocked `WfRun` can finish. What this does is start a daemon which calls the `verify_identity()` Python function for every scheduled `TaskRun` with appropriate parameters.

```sh
python -m quickstart.workers
```

Once the workers starts up, please open another terminal and inspect our `WfRun` again:

```sh
lhctl get wfRun <wf_run_id>
```

Voila! It's completed. You can also verify that the Task Queue is empty now that the Task Workers executed all of the tasks:

```sh
lhctl search taskRun verify-identity --taskDefName verify-identity --status TASK_SCHEDULED
```

The example has been configured for this task to fail 25% of the time to demonstrate LittleHorse's ability to handle retries and failures.

## Posting an Event

You will notice that the `verify-identity` task completed successfully but, the workflow is still in the `RUNNING` state. This is because the workflow is waiting for an external event `identity-verified` to be posted to the workflow.

Normally in a real-world application, you would have some other service that would post an event to the workflow with webhooks. For this example, we will just use the `lhctl` command to post an event to the workflow.

```sh
lhctl postEvent <wf_run_id> identity-verified BOOL true
```

If you want the workflow to know that the identity was not able to be verified, you can post an event with a `BOOL` value of `false`.

```sh
lhctl postEvent <wf_run_id> identity-verified BOOL false
```

If you go to the `WfRun` page in your browser, you will see that the workflow has completed and the customer has been notified that whether their identity has been verified or not.

# Next Steps
